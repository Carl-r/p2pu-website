Piet has been quietly learning about learning for several years,
many of them while working with the University of Michigan’s Open.
Michigan initiative. He is a founding volunteer with the School of Open,
but also contributes to P2PU’s work on mentorship, interface design,
the Open Masters project, and pretty much any place people are thinking
about the intersections of learning, identity, and information.

			<h2 class="text-center">What We’re All About</h2>

			Peer 2 Peer University (we mostly just say P2PU) is a grassroots open education project that
			organizes learning outside of institutional walls and gives learners recognition for their
			achievements. P2PU creates a model for lifelong learning alongside traditional formal higher
			education. Leveraging the internet and educational materials openly available online, P2PU
			enables high-quality low-cost education opportunities.

			<h2 class="text-center">Our values</h2>

			Three things guide everything we do: <i>openness, community and peer learning</i>.

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>P2PU is open</strong>Being open enables more people to participate and innovate,
					and makes us accountable. Our community is open so that everyone can participate. Our
					content is open so that everyone can use it. Our model & technology are open so others can
					experiment with it and we can all improve it together. Our processes are open so that we
					remain accountable to our purpose and community.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>P2PU is a community</strong>P2PU is community-centered and our governance model
					reflects that. P2PU is built driven by volunteers, who are involved in all aspects of the
					project. As members of this community, we speak and act with civility. We show tolerance
					and respect for other opinions, people, and perspectives. We strive for quality as a
					process – driven by community-review, feedback and revision.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>P2PU is peer learning</strong>P2PU is teaching and learning by peers for peers.
					Everyone has something to contribute and everyone has something to learn. We are all
					teachers & learners. We take responsibility for our own and each others’ learning.
				</li>

	<h2>The Philosophy</h2>

	<h3>How We Learn...</h3>

	<p>
		One of our core values is “peer learning.” It’s kind of a wonky term, but we’ve grown to love
		it. Generally we use it as a shorthand for the following framework for learning:
	</p>

	<div class="row">

		<div class="col-md-4 ">
			<h2>Expertise</h2>
			<h4>everyone has it:</h4>

			<p>
				in the average P2PU learning group, you might have a super-organized project manager, a
				whip-smart headline writer, a shark of a negotiator and an exhibition designer. No matter
				what the subject of the course, everyone brings their suite of skills and experiences to the
				team. In this light “expertise” doesn’t necessarily mean a skill that is recognized by a
				degree or a job title, but instead refers to a more informal definition of talent. What is
				the ability to bake a cake, anyway, if not an arena of expertise?
			</p>
		</div>


		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>Sharing</h2>
			<h4>and connecting is how we learn:</h4>

			<p>
				every single P2PU experience will ask you to work on something together and share it.
				Whether it’s a team-based project such as the <a
					href="http://info.p2pu.org/2013/04/29/at-the-cockpit-how-the-data-explorer-mission-works/">
				Data Explorer </a>, a peer review team such as <a
					href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/111/copyright-4-educators-aus/">Copyright 4
				Educators</a>, or making an HTML file with the <a
					href="https://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-webcraft/">School of Webcraft</a>, interacting
				with others, sharing your work and imparting your knowledge is part-and-parcel of the
				learning experience.
			</p>
		</div>


		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>Feedback</h2>
			<h4>is necessary in order to improve:</h4>

			<p>
				at P2PU, we believe that delivering feedback is a kind of learning. We built our friendly
				assessment platform <a href="http://badges.p2pu.org">Badges</a> around that very principle.
				When you submit a project, another P2PU community member will give you feedback to help
				extend your learning.
			</p>

			<p>
				The feedback helps you by honing on your individual needs, and helps the P2PU member learn
				more by diagnosing where you’re at with the project.
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>
		Those are the core elements of what you can expect from every peer learning experience, and they
		can take many forms.

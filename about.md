# What We’re All About
Peer 2 Peer University (we mostly just say P2PU) is a grassroots open education project that
organizes learning outside of institutional walls and gives learners recognition for their
achievements. P2PU creates a model for lifelong learning alongside traditional formal higher
education. Leveraging the internet and educational materials openly available online,
P2PU enables high-quality low-cost education opportunities.

#### Learning for the people, by the people. About almost anything.

## Our values
Three things guide everything we do: **openness, community and peer learning**.

**P2PU is open** Being open enables more people to participate and innovate,
and makes us accountable. Our community is open so that everyone can participate. Our content is
open so that everyone can use it. Our model & technology are open so others can experiment with
it and we can all improve it together. Our processes are open so that we remain accountable to
our purpose and community.

**P2PU is a community** P2PU is community-centered and our governance model reflects that. P2PU is
built driven by volunteers, who are involved in all aspects of the project. As members of this
community, we speak and act with civility. We show tolerance and respect for other opinions,
people, and perspectives. We strive for quality as a process – driven by community-review,
feedback and revision.

**P2PU is peer learning** P2PU is teaching and learning by peers for peers. Everyone has something
to contribute and everyone has something to learn. We are all teachers & learners. We take
responsibility for our own and each others’ learning.

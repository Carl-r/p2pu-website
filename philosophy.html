	<h3>How We Learn...</h3>

	<p>
		One of our core values is “peer learning.” It’s kind of a wonky term, but we’ve grown to love
		it.
		Generally we use it as a shorthand for the following framework for learning:
	</p>

	<div class="inline-content-img clearfix">

		<div class="col-md-2 philosophy-list-title">Expertise -</div>

		<div class="col-md-8 first">
			<h4>everyone has it:</h4>

			<p>
				in the average P2PU learning group, you might have a super-organized
				project manager, a whip-smart headline writer, a shark of a negotiator and an exhibition
				designer.
				No matter what the subject of the course, everyone brings their suite of
				skills and experiences to the team. In this light “expertise” doesn’t necessarily
				mean a skill that is recognized by a degree or a job title, but instead refers to a
				more informal definition of talent. What is the ability to bake a cake, anyway,
				if not an arena of expertise?
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>


	<div class="inline-content-img clearfix">
		<div class="col-md-2 philosophy-list-title">sharing -</div>

		<div class="col-md-8 first">
			<h4>and connecting is how we learn:</h4>

			<p>
				every single P2PU experience will ask you to work on something together and share it.
				Whether it’s a team-based project such as the
				<a href="http://info.p2pu.org/2013/04/29/at-the-cockpit-how-the-data-explorer-mission-works/">
					Data Explorer
				</a>, a peer review team such as
				<a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/111/copyright-4-educators-aus/">Copyright 4
				                                                                     Educators</a>,
				or making an HTML file with the
				<a href="https://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-webcraft/">School of Webcraft</a>,
				interacting with others, sharing your work and imparting your knowledge is part-and-parcel
				of
				the learning experience.
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>


	<div class="inline-content-img clearfix">
		<div class="col-md-2 philosophy-list-title">feedback -</div>

		<div class="col-md-8 first">
			<h4>is necessary in order to improve:</h4>

			<p>
				at P2PU, we believe that delivering feedback is a kind of learning.
				We built our friendly assessment platform <a href="http://badges.p2pu.org">Badges</a>
				around that very principle. When you submit a project, another P2PU community member will
				give you feedback to help extend your learning. Here’s an example from our Data Explorer
				Mission:
			</p>

			<p>
				<img src="{{ '/images/feedback.png'|prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Feedback cover image" />
			</p>

			<p>
				The feedback helps you by honing on your individual needs,
				and helps the P2PU member learn more by diagnosing where you’re at with the project.
			</p>

	</div>
	<p>
		Those are the core elements of what you can expect from every peer learning experience,
		and they can take many forms.
	</p>

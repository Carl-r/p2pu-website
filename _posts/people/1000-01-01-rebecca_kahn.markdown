If Bekka were ever to leave p2pu it would fall apart.
We have in the past thought about renaming p2pu to the Kahn Academy
but that created too much confusion with other initiatives.
Bekka really is the heart and soul of p2pu; any users who are
frustrated with the automaton p2pu.org come in and talk to Bekka.
Sheâ€™ll make you a nice cup of tea.

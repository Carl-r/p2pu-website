Niels is a man of many talents. He’ll beat you hands down playing cards,
but then he’ll make you dinner afterwards. A founding volunteer at P2PU,
Niels ran courses on Poker and Strategic Thinking and Molecular Gastronomy,
and keeps asking us difficult questions, which is why we like to keep him around.

It appears to be so that Paul likes forks, regardless of whether these are
pitchforks or software forks. Itâ€™s been great for him that he found his 2 places where he can
combine his forking hobbies, his forked Mozilla drumbeat.org code is the basis of p2pu as we now
know it, and he is currently employed as a developer evangelist at SoundCloud.

As original gang-star par excellence, Neeru didn’t think it was enough to theorize about
starting a peer learning platform so she co-founded p2pu and created and organized the
‘Behavioral Economics’ pilot course at p2pu. Neeru has been at the root of P2U’s success in many
ways and now employs her vast experience on the board.

Alison’s famous catchphrase: ‘Just like, do it.’ (free after a famous sportswear company)
has stuck with p2pu since the fall of 2009. She ‘just made’ most of the instructional
materials and has now left p2pu to do an open masters while inspiring others to ‘just keep doing’
as much as possible for p2pu.
